<p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and 
demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee
 the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
 through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases 
 are perfectly simple</p>
 <p>and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled a
 nd when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
 every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations 
 of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. 
 The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures
 to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
